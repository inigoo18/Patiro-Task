# Patiro-Task

This is a solution built with Visual Studio.

In Patiro-Task, you can find the source code for the first task of the test.

In Patiro-Task2, you can find the source code for the second task.

Finally, the design decisions for both tasks can be found in the Task Documentation PDF. (since task 2 builds on top of task 1, 
I found it necessary to document how this first task was carried out.)
